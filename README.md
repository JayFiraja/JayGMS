# JayGMS
Sample GMS to showcase the asset in a unity project.

Quick start guide **GMS - Game Management Service version 1_0**
found in path: "JayGMS\Assets\GMS\Quick Start Guide"

For the URP Tic tac toe example open scene **TicTacToe_Example** and hit play.

For the URP MinimalExample open Scene **MinimalExample** and hit play.

For the example that swaps game managers open **Minimal_SwappingGameManagers** and hit play.

Note: Since this is an asset for the asset store I included scenes supporting URP and Built in Renderers.

Please use URP renderer example scenes as this unity project has URP setup.
